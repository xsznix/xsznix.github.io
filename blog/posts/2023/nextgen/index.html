    <article class="astro-ISEESVOS"><p>Hi, baby,</p>
<p>Welcome to this wonderful world! It’s only been a few weeks since you joined us, but I’m already so excited for you. You’ll have so much fun being alive. I can’t wait for you to try yummy food from around the world, sing along to pretty music that fills your heart with joy, and solve tricky puzzles that tickle your brain.</p>
<p>Many people before you have worked hard to make your life easier than theirs ever were. When I was young, my family was too poor to buy the toys all the other kids had. You’ll never have that experience. Your grandparents had to move to a new country far away from home to learn and find better jobs. You’ll never need to do that. It’ll be hard for you to understand how it feels to not have what you need. But I’ll try my best to help you appreciate all the little things you might take for granted.</p>
<p>As long as I’m taking care of you, my goal is to make you a better person than me. I don’t want you to just be me, but better. I want you to be yourself, the best version of yourself you can be. I promise to do everything I can to help you reach your full potential. If you find something that interests you, I’ll learn with you and give you what you need to explore it. I’ll encourage you to believe in yourself and challenge yourself, even when other people give up or settle for less. That way, you can be one of the best at whatever you want to succeed at. As for everything else, don’t worry about being perfect. As long as you’re happy, that’s good enough. Focus on what you’re great at.</p>
<p>As you grow up, you’ll meet many grown-ups who want to influence you. Be careful who you take advice from. Take your career advice from someone who has done well in their work, your romantic advice from someone who has been happily married for a long time, your financial advice from someone who has plenty of money and puts it to good use, your health advice from someone who is healthier than other people their age, and your faith advice from someone who inspires you to be loving and kind. Sometimes, grown-ups want you to listen to them even though they haven’t done much with the chances they’ve had. They think being older makes them smarter than you, but that’s not always true. Don’t take their advice. It didn’t help them, so it won’t help you. Most importantly of all, think carefully about your own ideas and actions. When you’re wrong, admit it bravely and change your mind. That’s the only way you can improve and become like the people you admire.</p>
<p>Your age group will come up with amazing ideas we couldn’t imagine. You’ll use technology in new ways we can’t keep up with. You’ll find mistakes in our beliefs that we don’t want to see. You’ll see problems in our culture and politics that make the world less fair and pleasant. Your age group will try to fix all of these problems. Many people in my age group won’t like the changes you make. They’ll say you’re attacking who they are and how they live. Don’t let them make you feel bad. Your children and grandchildren will look up to those in your age group who make the world better. The people who fight against them will be remembered as bad guys. I can’t promise I’ll fully understand you when your age group leads the world forward, but I <em>will</em> be proud of you.</p>
<p>Our family is working hard to set you up for success. But don’t be held back by our hopes and dreams for you. Don’t limit yourself to the boxes that other people want to put you in. You can do greater things than we can imagine. Go, be amazing, and make the world a better place.</p></article>
