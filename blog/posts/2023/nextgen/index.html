    <article class="astro-V453TSYP"><p>Hi, baby,</p>
<p>Welcome to this wonderful world! It’s only been a few weeks since you joined us, but I’m already so excited for you. You will have so much fun being alive. I can’t wait for you to try yummy food from around the world, sing along to pretty music that fills your heart with joy, and solve tricky puzzles that tickle your brain.</p>
<p>Many people before you have worked hard to make your life easier than theirs ever were. When I was young, my family was too poor to buy the toy all the other kids have. You will never have that experience. Your grandparents had to move to an entirely new country to learn and find better jobs. You will never need to do that. It’ll be hard for you to understand what it’s like to not have what you need. But I will try my best to help you appreciate all the little things you might take for granted.</p>
<p>As long as I’m taking care of you, my goal is to make you an even better person than me. I don’t want you to just be me, but better. I want you to be yourself, the best version of yourself you can be. I promise to do everything I can to help you reach your full potential. If you find something that interests you, I will learn with you and give you what you need to explore it. I will encourage you to believe in yourself and challenge yourself, even if people around you give up or settle for less. That way, you can be one of the best in whatever you want to succeed at. As for everything else, don’t worry about being perfect. Just be good enough to survive and focus on what you’re good at.</p>
<p>As you grow up, you will meet many adults who want to influence you. Be careful who you take advice from. Take your career advice from someone who has done well in their work, your romantic advice from someone who has been happily married for a long time, your financial advice from someone who has plenty of money and puts it to good use, and your health advice from someone who is healthier than other people their age. Don’t listen to adults who demand your respect just because they are older than you but have nothing to show for it. Their advice will only make you be like them. Most of all, think carefully about your own ideas and actions so you can improve and become like the people you admire.</p>
<p>Your generation will come up with ideas that ours couldn’t imagine. You will create new ways to use technology that we can’t keep up with. You will find flaws in our beliefs that we will refuse to admit. You will take issue with problems in our culture and politics that prevent the world from being more fair and pleasant. Your generation will come up with solutions to all of these problems. Many people in my generation will resist these changes as attacks to their identity and way of life, just as every generation did before them. I can’t promise I will still fully understand you when that day comes, but I will be proud of you.</p>
<p>Don’t be held back by my hopes and dreams for you, or by the boxes that other people want to put you in. You can do greater things than we can imagine. Go, be amazing, and make the world a better place.</p></article>
